üìù Bio
---
I am a PhD fellow at the [Multispeech team](https://team.inria.fr/multispeech/), affiliated with the [Universit√© de Lorraine](https://www.univ-lorraine.fr), [CNRS](https://www.centre-est.cnrs.fr/fr), and [Inria](https://www.inria.fr/fr/centre-inria-universite-lorraine) ([Loria](https://www.loria.fr/fr/)). My research, under the supervision of Dr. [Romain Serizel](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_PXk20cAAAAJ&hl=en) and Dr. [Paul Magron](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=67-Uh0cAAAAJ&hl=en), focuses on developing an objective function to enhance deep neural network (DNN) speech enhancement (SE) models, specifically targeting sensorineural hearing loss. As part of the [REFINED](https://anr.fr/Projet-ANR-21-CE19-0043) ANR project, I collaborate closely with the [Pasteur Institute](https://www.institut-audition.fr/ceriah) (Paris), which contributes to the medical aspects of the project, and [CEA](https://www.cea.fr/paris-saclay/Pages/Accueil.aspx) (Paris) which focuses on optimizing these models for embedded systems.
