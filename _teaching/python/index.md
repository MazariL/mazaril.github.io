## Practicals 0, 1, 2 and 3
Please refer to [Fanny Ducel's website](https://fannyducel.github.io/teaching/) for these first practicals.

## Practical 4
<p style="text-align: justify;">
This practical serves as a recap of the first three lectures, covering the essential building blocks of Python. You'll reinforce your understanding of <strong>arithmetic</strong> and <strong>logical operations</strong>, and learn how to work with <strong>variables</strong> for data storage and manipulation in Python. You'll then dive into handling <strong>strings</strong> and <strong>controlling the flow</strong> of your programs using conditional statements (<code>if</code>, <code>else</code>, <code>elif</code>).

Next, you'll explore the use of <strong>loops</strong> (<code>for</code> and <code>while</code>) to repeat actions efficiently. The practical will also guide you through organizing data using <strong>lists</strong>, and working with <strong>dictionaries</strong> to store data in <strong>key-value</strong> pairs. Finally, you'll practice writing <strong>functions</strong> to create reusable blocks of code.

## Practical 5
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this practical, you will solidify your understanding of Python by working with <strong>modules</strong>, <strong>packages</strong>, and <strong>functions</strong>. You'll start by creating a <strong>package</strong> with multiple <strong>modules</strong>, defining <strong>functions</strong>, and importing them into your Jupyter notebook. Through hands-on exercises, you will learn how to organize, manipulate, and preprocess data efficiently using Python‚Äôs built-in features and packages. This practical also introduces advanced topics like <strong>wrapper functions</strong> and <strong>documentation</strong> using <strong>NumPy-style docstrings</strong>, preparing you for more complex programming tasks.
