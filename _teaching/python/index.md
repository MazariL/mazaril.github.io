### Basics (Operations and Variables)
Learn the fundamental building blocks of Python, including arithmetic and logical operations. This section also introduces variables and how to assign and manipulate data in Python. Start practicing [here](practical_1/).

### Strings
Explore how to work with text in Python using strings. You'll learn string manipulation techniques such as concatenation, slicing, and common string methods to handle textual data efficiently. Begin practicing [here](practical_2/).

### Control Flow
Understand how to control the flow of your programs with conditional statements like `if`, `else`, and `elif`. This section covers making decisions in your code based on logical conditions. Practice control flow [here](practical_3/).

### Loops
Learn how to repeat actions using loops in Python. This section covers `for` and `while` loops, allowing you to iterate over data and perform repeated tasks efficiently. Start practicing loops [here](practical_4/).

### Lists, Sets and Tuples
Discover how to store and organize data using lists, sets, and tuples. You'll learn the differences between these data structures and how to manipulate and access their elements. Practice with lists, sets, and tuples [here](practical_5/).

### Dictionaries
Understand how to use dictionaries to store data in key-value pairs. This section teaches you how to create, access, modify, and iterate over dictionary items in Python. Begin practicing with dictionaries [here](practical_6/).

### Functions
Learn how to write reusable blocks of code with functions. This section covers function definitions, parameters, return values, and how to use functions to organize and structure your programs. Start practicing functions [here](practical_7/).
