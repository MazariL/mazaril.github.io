## Practicals 0, 1, 2 and 3
Please refer to [Fanny Ducel](https://fannyducel.github.io/teaching/) for these first practicals.

## Practical 4
<p style="text-align: justify;">
This practical serves as a recap of the first three lectures, covering the essential building blocks of Python. You'll reinforce your understanding of **arithmetic** and **logical operations**, and learn how to work with **variables** for data storage and manipulation in Python. You'll then dive into handling **strings** and **controlling the flow** of your programs using conditional statements (`if`, `else`, `elif`).

Next, you'll explore the use of **loops** (`for` and `while`) to repeat actions efficiently. The practical will also guide you through organizing data using **lists**, and working with **dictionaries** to store data in **key-value** pairs. Finally, you'll practice writing **functions** to create reusable blocks of code.

## Practical 5
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this practical, you will solidify your understanding of Python by working with **modules**, **packages**, and **functions**. You'll start by creating a **package** with multiple **modules**, defining **functions**, and importing them into your Jupyter notebook. Through hands-on exercises, you will learn how to organize, manipulate, and preprocess data efficiently using Python‚Äôs built-in features and packages. This practical also introduces advanced topics like **wrapper functions** and **documentation** using **NumPy-style docstrings**, preparing you for more complex programming tasks.
