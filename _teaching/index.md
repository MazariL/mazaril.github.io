###### MSc NLP and Master in Cognitive Science, IDMC - UniversitÃ© de Lorraine, 2023-2025.

These Python practicals follow [KarÃ«n Fort's lectures](https://members.loria.fr/KFort/idmc-nancy-from-2024/). You'll learn Python fundamentalsâ€”strings, control flow, loops, lists, tuples, sets, and file handling. Exercises include working with the "80jours50l" and "MyBiblio" files. We'll cover dictionaries, functions, modules, and key libraries like NumPy and Pandas. The course ends with a brief session on objects. Each topic includes interactive notebooks. I'll be supervising a group and guiding you through the exercises.
