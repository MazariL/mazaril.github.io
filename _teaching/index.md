## Introduction to Python ![emoji](/images/python-logo.jpeg){:height="40px" width="40px"}

##### MSc NLP and Master in Cognitive Science, IDMC - Universit√© de Lorraine, 2023-2025.

I am supervising Python practicals that follow Pr. [Kar√´n Fort's lectures](https://members.loria.fr/KFort/idmc-nancy-from-2024/), covering essential Python fundamentals such as strings, control flow, loops, lists, tuples, sets, and file handling. The practicals involve working with real-world examples like the ‚Äú80jours50l‚Äù and ‚ÄúMyBiblio‚Äù files. Additionally, topics such as dictionaries, functions, modules, and key libraries like NumPy and Pandas are explored, concluding with a session on objects. Each topic is accompanied by interactive notebooks, and guidance is provided throughout all the exercises.

## Introduction to Docker ![emoji](/images/docker-logo.png){:height="35px" width="35px"}

##### Bachelor in Computer Science, IUT Nancy Charlemagne - Universit√© de Lorraine, 2023-2024.

I am teaching a comprehensive introduction to virtualization, incorporating both lectures and practicals. The materials given to students, including the slides, are built upon the courses of the Associate Professor [Philippe Dosch](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?hl=fr&user=fYCvan0AAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate). The course covers key virtualization concepts such as containers, hypervisors, and virtual machines, along with practical applications of Docker and KVM. The student will engage in hands-on exercises to solidify his/her understanding of these topics, gaining experience in both system administration and deployment in virtualized environments. The course balances theoretical foundations with practical implementations.
