Here's the cheat sheet formatted in Markdown code snippets:

## First Start
- **print()**: Outputs text to the console.
```python
print("Hi Nasser!")
```

## Operations and Variables
- **Operations**: 
  - `+` (addition): `2 + 3` results in `5`
  - `-` (subtraction): `5 - 2` results in `3`
  - `*` (multiplication): `4 * 3` results in `12`
  - `/` (division): `10 / 2` results in `5.0`
  - `**` (exponentiation): `2 ** 3` results in `8`
  - `//` (floor division): `7 // 2` results in `3`
  - `%` (modulus): `10 % 3` results in `1`
  
- **Variable Assignment**: Assigns a value to a variable.
```python
  x = 10
```
