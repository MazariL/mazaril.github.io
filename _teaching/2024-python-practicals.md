These Python practicals follow the lectures of [Karën Fort](https://members.loria.fr/KFort/idmc-nancy-from-2024/). Throughout the course, you will be introduced to Python, starting with foundational concepts such as strings, control flow, and loops. You'll then explore lists, tuples, sets, and file handling, with practical exercises like working on the "80jours50l" file. As we progress, you'll dive into dictionaries and functions using the "MyBiblio" file, followed by a recap to reinforce your learning. After that, we’ll cover Python modules, how to use Python outside of Jupyter notebooks, and introduce essential libraries like NumPy and Pandas. We'll conclude with a brief session on objects. Each topic comes with interactive notebooks to ensure hands-on practice. I will be supervising one group of these sessions, guiding you through the exercises and helping you strengthen your Python skills.

# Recap & Reinforcement
======
Focuses on reinforcing key concepts such as operations, variables, and control flow with targeted exercises and reviews.

### Operations and Variables
======
This chapter introduces the foundational concepts of Python programming, covering arithmetic operations, logical comparisons, and variable assignment. You’ll learn how to manipulate data using basic operators and store results in variables for later use.

### Strings
======
This chapter dives into string manipulation, exploring methods for handling and modifying text. You'll learn to slice, concatenate, and format strings, as well as work with essential string methods to process textual data effectively.

### Lists and Sets
======
In this chapter, you’ll explore two powerful data structures in Python: lists and sets. Lists allow you to store and manipulate ordered collections of elements, while sets provide a way to manage unique, unordered collections. You’ll learn common operations for both, such as indexing, adding/removing elements, and set operations.

### Dictionaries
======
This chapter focuses on dictionaries, a versatile Python data structure that maps keys to values. You'll learn how to create and modify dictionaries, retrieve values efficiently, and work with nested dictionaries for more complex data management tasks.

### Functions
======
This chapter introduces functions, enabling you to create reusable blocks of code. You’ll learn about defining functions, passing arguments, returning values, and working with default parameters. The concept of scope and the use of higher-order functions will also be covered to help you write more efficient, modular code.
